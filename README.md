# Tech Blog

## Description
This assignment is a MVC assignment utilizing NodeJS, Sequelize, JawsDB, and Handlebars.js. Multiple Javascript files were used with controller/models/handlebar files set up in a modular fashion for ease of development. This resulted in a CMS-style blog site used to publish articles, blog posts, and and share thoughts and opinions on tech-related topics. Below is a screenshot of and a link to the deployed application on Heroku.
